# Target Users

## Primary Audience

The primary users of our web application, **BudgetWise**, are young professionals aged 22-35 who are early in their careers and looking to establish strong financial habits. These individuals often have a steady income but may struggle with managing expenses, budgeting, and saving for future goals. Many of them are technologically adept and prefer using modern tools like mobile apps to manage various aspects of their lives, including personal finances. Our application will also cater to families and working parents, who are often managing multiple income sources and expenses, seeking to maintain better control over their household finances. Additionally, college students, who are starting to learn about financial independence, are another key audience. While their income may be limited, they can benefit from budgeting tools to ensure they make the most out of their funds.

## User Needs

Young professionals face the challenge of balancing multiple expenses, such as rent, utilities, student loans, and discretionary spending on entertainment or dining out. They need a tool that simplifies the process of tracking and categorizing expenses, helps them visualize their spending habits, and provides insights into areas where they can save more effectively. Many are looking for a solution that is easy to use, accessible on both mobile and desktop devices, and can seamlessly integrate into their daily routines. 

Families, on the other hand, need an application that allows them to track household expenses, manage shared financial goals (such as saving for their children's education or purchasing a home), and make informed decisions on budget allocations for essentials like groceries and utilities. For these users, a tool that provides an overview of joint finances while allowing for individual tracking is essential.

College students typically need help managing limited funds. They need a tool that not only tracks their spending but also helps them plan ahead for upcoming expenses, like tuition payments or textbooks. They benefit from a solution that simplifies financial management and teaches them good budgeting practices early in life.
