# Problem Statement

## Problem Description

Many individuals struggle with tracking their personal finances in a meaningful way. With multiple transactions happening daily (groceries, entertainment, utilities), people often lose track of how much they are spending and in which categories. This lack of clarity can lead to overspending, poor budgeting decisions, and financial stress. While some people use spreadsheets or basic budgeting apps, these tools often lack advanced features like automatic expense categorization or visual data that helps users quickly assess their financial health.

## Proposed Solution

Our web application, **BudgetWise**, aims to provide a more intuitive and  visual solution for tracking personal finances. BudgetWise will allow  users to easily log their income and expenses and automatically categorize  transactions based on the type of purchase. Users will have access to real-time data visualizations that provide insights into their spending habits, allowing them to set goals and track their progress.

Key features include:

- **Expense Categorization**: Automatically categorize expenses into 
  categories like groceries, utilities, and entertainment.
- **Visual Analytics**: Present real-time graphs and charts that display 
  monthly spending trends, allowing users to compare against previous 
  months.
- **Goal Setting**: Users can set personal financial goals, such as 
  saving for a vacation or reducing spending in a specific category, and 
  track their progress.
- **Multi-Device Access**: Accessible on both desktop and mobile devices, 
  allowing users to input expenses on the go.

By providing a tool that is both easy to use and packed with advanced 
features, BudgetWise aims to reduce the financial stress that comes with 
poor money management.

## Why This Matters

In todayâ€™s world, many people face financial uncertainty and stress, often 
due to poor budgeting habits or a lack of understanding about their 
spending behavior. By addressing this issue, BudgetWise helps users become 
more financially literate, make better spending decisions, and ultimately 
improve their financial well-being. The application not only simplifies 
the process of tracking expenses, but it also empowers users to take 
control of their finances, reduce debt, and save for future goals. In 
the long run, this contributes to greater financial stability and peace 
of mind for our target users, particularly young professionals and 
families.
