## Main Dashboard Screen

The **Main Dashboard** is the first screen users will see after logging into the application. The layout is designed to provide a quick overview of the user’s financial health, with a clean and simple interface that makes it easy to understand at a glance. The dashboard will display the total amount spent for the current month, a breakdown of expenses by category (such as groceries, utilities, and entertainment), and the user’s progress toward any active savings goals.
