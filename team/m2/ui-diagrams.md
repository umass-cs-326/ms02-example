## Main Dashboard Screen

The **Main Dashboard** is the first screen users will see after logging into the application. The layout is designed to provide a quick overview of the user’s financial health, with a clean and simple interface that makes it easy to understand at a glance. The dashboard will display the total amount spent for the current month, a breakdown of expenses by category (such as groceries, utilities, and entertainment), and the user’s progress toward any active savings goals.

On this screen, users can interact with three main elements:

1. **Spending Overview**: A pie chart that visually represents the user's spending across different categories. Hovering over each slice of the pie will display the exact amount spent in that category, giving users a detailed breakdown without overwhelming them with numbers.
2. **Savings Goals Progress Bar**: Below the pie chart, there will be a progress bar showing the user’s progress toward their savings goal. This element provides a quick visual indicator of how close the user is to achieving their goal.
3. **Expense Log Button**: A prominent button labeled “Log Expense” will be located at the top right of the dashboard. Clicking this button will take users to the **Expense Logging Screen**, where they can add new expenses.
